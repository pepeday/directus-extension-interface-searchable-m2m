Searchable-M2M Interface
1. Relationship Structure
The searchable-m2m interface handles many-to-many relationships with the following structure:
Junction Collection: The intermediate collection that connects two entities (e.g., processes_risk_assessments)
Junction Field: The field in the junction collection that points to the related item (e.g., risk_assessments_id)
Reverse Junction Field: The field in the junction collection that points back to the parent item (e.g., processes_id)
Related Collection: The collection of items being related (e.g., risk_assessments)
Related Primary Key Field: The primary key field of the related collection (typically id)
2. Item States
Items in the interface can have several states:
Existing Items: Already saved in the database
Staged Created Items: New items that haven't been saved yet
Staged Updated Items: Existing items with pending changes
Staged Deleted Items: Existing items marked for deletion
3. Drawer-Item Integration Requirements
When opening the drawer-item component:
For Existing Items:
Pass the junction collection as the collection prop
Pass the junction item's primary key as the primary-key prop
Pass the junction field name as the junction-field prop
Pass the related item's primary key as the related-primary-key prop
Pass any staged edits as the edits prop
2. For New Items:
Pass the junction collection as the collection prop
Pass '+' as the primary-key prop
Pass the junction field name as the junction-field prop
Pass the related item's primary key as the related-primary-key prop (or '+' if creating both)
Pass initial values as the edits prop
3. For Staged Items:
Handle similarly to new items but include any staged data
4. Handling Edits
When the drawer-item emits an input event:
For New Items:
Add the edits to the staged changes as a creation
Include both junction data and related item data
For Existing Items:
Add the edits to the staged changes as an update
Preserve the primary keys and relationship structure
For Staged Items:
Update the existing staged changes
5. Implementation Steps
Fix the openEditDrawer function to properly set up the editing state
Ensure editingItem has the correct structure
Update the handleUpdate function to properly process edits
Fix how we pass props to the drawer-item component
Ensure the drawer-item can properly load related items
6. Key Considerations
The drawer-item component expects specific prop structures
We need to maintain the relationship between junction items and related items
We need to handle both new and existing items correctly
We need to ensure primary keys are correctly passed
We need to handle the case where a related item doesn't exist yet

------------------------------------------
## Improved Staging Strategy

### The Problem with Current Implementation
The current implementation in searchable-m2m has several issues:
1. Temporary staging IDs like `_stageId` are being included in the raw data sent to Directus
2. Staged items are not properly reflected in the display until a server refresh
3. Changes to staged items are sometimes lost when new items are added

### Staging Strategy Based on list-m2m.vue

1. **Clean Staging Data Structure**
   - All staged data should use the same structure as real data from the API
   - Before emitting changes to the parent component, temporary fields like `_stageId` should be stripped out
   - Use local reactive variables to track which items are staged vs. saved

2. **Display Layer vs. Data Layer**
   - Separate the concept of "display items" from "data items"
   - displayItems should include both real items and staged items
   - A consolidation function should merge real items with staged changes for display

3. **Two-Phase Staging Process**
   - Phase 1: Stage changes locally in UI with visual indicators (use temporary IDs only for UI)
   - Phase 2: When emitting to parent, clean the data structure to match what Directus expects

4. **Item Uniqueness**
   - Real items: Identified by their actual junction IDs
   - New items: Track with temporary IDs that don't get sent to the server
   - Updated items: Match by junction IDs
   - Deleted items: Store IDs in a deleted array

### Key Functional Areas

| Function Area | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Staging | Prepare changes but don't emit yet |
| Consolidation | Merge local + API data for display |
| Emitting | Clean staging data and send to parent |
| Refreshing | Update the display when data changes |

### Internal Tracking vs. External Data

| Type | Internal Tracking | Data for Directus |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| New Items | Use _stageId for UI tracking | Strip out before emitting |
| Updated Items | Track by ID + _stageId | Only include actual fields to update |
| Deleted Items | Mark with deleted status | Add ID to delete array |

### Workflow for Adding Items

1. Stage item with temporary ID for internal tracking
2. Add to display items array for immediate visual feedback
3. When emitting to parent, create a clean version without temporary fields
4. On subsequent display refreshes, merge API items with staged items

### Emit Clean Values to Parent Component

Before emitting data to the parent component, ensure:
1. No temporary tracking fields (`_stageId`, `_status`, etc.)
2. Data structure matches exactly what Directus expects
3. Junction fields and related fields are properly structured

------------------------------------------
## Comparison of Staging Functions between list-m2m.vue and searchable-m2m.vue

| Function | list-m2m.vue | searchable-m2m.vue | Recommendation |
|----------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Item Selection** | `select()` - Properly handles async operations and batches items | `stageDrawerSelection()` - Processes one item at a time and doesn't handle async well | Adopt the list-m2m approach using Promise.all for batch processing |
| **Item Creation** | `create()` - Creates clean item structure with proper junction relation | `stageLocalInput()` - Uses temporary IDs without proper cleanup before emission | Ensure temporary fields are stripped before emission |
| **Item Update** | `update()` - Receives item with existing ID, updates without side effects | `handleUpdate()` - Mixed responsibility for both updates and creation | Separate concerns into distinct functions |
| **Item Deletion** | `remove()` - Handles deletion of both saved and local items | `deleteItem()` - Handles deletion but doesn't update the display immediately | Add immediate display updates on deletion |
| **Item Tracking** | Uses `$type` and `$edits` for UI without affecting the actual data | Uses `_stageId` which gets sent to the server | Use UI-only tracking that doesn't affect the data structure |
| **Display Refresh** | Automatic refresh via computed property `displayItems` | Manual refresh via function calls | Use computed properties for automatic updates |
| **Value Emission** | Cleans data structure before emitting | Emits raw data with temporary fields | Add a clean-up step before emission |
| **Batching Changes** | `stageBatchEdits()` - Processes multiple items at once | No equivalent | Add batch processing capability |
| **Item State Management** | Clear distinction between `isLocalItem()` and saved items | Mixed tracking via `_stageId` | Use clear state indicators that don't affect the data |
| **Junction Structure** | Maintains clear structure with junction collection + related item | Sometimes creates improper structure | Enforce proper junction structure in all operations |

### Key Differences in Implementation

1. **Data Structure**
   - list-m2m: Maintains a clean separation between UI state and data structure
   - searchable-m2m: Mixes UI state with data structure, leading to temporary fields being sent to Directus

2. **Asynchronous Handling**
   - list-m2m: Properly handles async operations with Promise.all
   - searchable-m2m: Sequential async operations that can lead to race conditions

3. **Display Updates**
   - list-m2m: Computed properties automatically refresh the display
   - searchable-m2m: Manual refresh function that must be called explicitly

4. **Item Uniqueness**
   - list-m2m: Clear strategy for tracking items by ID or UI state
   - searchable-m2m: Mixed approach that can lead to duplicates or lost items

------------------------------------------
## Implementation Improvements

Based on our analysis, we've implemented the following key improvements to the `useStagedChanges` composable:

### 1. Clean Data Structure
- Added a `cleanStagedChanges` function that strips temporary fields before emission
- Created a computed `cleanedChanges` property that always returns clean data
- Modified all staging functions to return cleaned data for parent components

### 2. Display Layer Separation
- Added `displayItems` and `existingItems` refs to track display state
- Implemented a `consolidatedItems` computed property that automatically merges existing items with staged changes
- Added a watch to update `displayItems` whenever staged changes or existing items change

### 3. Improved Async Handling
- Enhanced `stageDrawerSelection` to use Promise.all for batch processing multiple items
- Added proper error handling and logging for all async operations
- Ensured consistent promise handling across all functions

### 4. Type Safety
- Added clear TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Created a `DisplayItem` interface for UI-only item properties
- Added proper return types to all functions

### 5. Better State Management
- Implemented `isLocalItem` and `isItemDeleted` helpers for proper item state checks
- Enhanced `deleteItem` to handle both local and saved items correctly
- Added the ability to toggle deletion state for existing items

### 6. Batch Operations
- Added `batchDeleteItems` for efficient bulk operations
- Enhanced item selection with better duplicate detection
- Implemented `loadExistingItems` for fetching data with proper field handling

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- Prevented unnecessary re-renders by using computed properties
- Avoided mutation of state by creating copies before modification
- Used efficient filters and finds instead of loops

### 8. Developer Experience
- Added comprehensive documentation to all functions
- Included debug logging for tracking operations
- Provided helper functions for common tasks

These improvements ensure that our `useStagedChanges` composable now closely aligns with the list-m2m.vue approach, with a clean separation between display and data layers, proper handling of temporary fields, and efficient batch operations.

This document will guide the implementation of fixes to ensure proper integration between the searchable-m2m interface and the drawer-item component, with a focus on proper staging and data emission.

## Staged Changes Implementation Plan

### 1. Core State Management
```typescript
// Base state structure
interface StagingState {
  displayItems: DisplayItem[];  // UI representation
  stagedChanges: {
    create: JunctionItem[];
    update: JunctionItem[];
    delete: string[];
  };
  existingItems: JunctionItem[];  // Items from API
}

// Each operation should be atomic and not affect others
```

### 2. Independent Staging Functions

#### A. Create Operations
1. `stageNewItem` (for text input)
   ```typescript
   function stageNewItem(value: string): void {
     // 1. Create junction structure
     // 2. Add to stagedChanges.create
     // 3. Update displayItems via computed
     // 4. Never modify existing items
   }
   ```

2. `stageDrawerSelection` (for collection items)
   ```typescript
   function stageDrawerSelection(items: Item[]): void {
     // 1. Process items in batch
     // 2. Add to stagedChanges.create
     // 3. Update displayItems via computed
     // 4. Maintain existing staged items
   }
   ```

#### B. Delete Operations
1. `deleteItem` (for single item)
   ```typescript
   function deleteItem(item: Item): void {
     // 1. Check item type (staged vs existing)
     // 2. For staged: Remove from stagedChanges.create
     // 3. For existing: Add to stagedChanges.delete
     // 4. Update displayItems via computed
   }
   ```

2. `batchDeleteItems` (for multiple items)
   ```typescript
   function batchDeleteItems(items: Item[]): void {
     // 1. Process each item independently
     // 2. Maintain consistent state
     // 3. Single displayItems update
   }
   ```

#### C. Update Operations
1. `stageUpdate` (for drawer edits)
   ```typescript
   function stageUpdate(item: Item, edits: Partial<Item>): void {
     // 1. Check if item is staged or existing
     // 2. For staged: Update in stagedChanges.create
     // 3. For existing: Add to stagedChanges.update
     // 4. Update displayItems via computed
   }
   ```

### 3. Display Management

#### A. Computed Properties
```typescript
const displayItems = computed(() => {
  // 1. Start with existing items
  // 2. Apply staged updates
  // 3. Add staged creations
  // 4. Filter out deleted items
  // 5. Add UI markers ($type, etc.)
});
```

#### B. State Updates
1. Value Prop Changes:
   ```typescript
   watch(() => props.value, (newValue) => {
     // 1. Only update if different
     // 2. Preserve staged changes
     // 3. Trigger single displayItems update
   });
   ```

2. Staged Changes:
   ```typescript
   watch(() => stagedChanges.value, (newChanges) => {
     // 1. Clean temporary fields
     // 2. Emit clean value
     // 3. Let displayItems computed update UI
   });
   ```

### 4. Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1: Core State**
   - Set up state structure
   - Implement displayItems computed
   - Add basic watchers

2. **Phase 2: Create Operations**
   - Implement stageNewItem
   - Test and verify displayItems update
   - Implement stageDrawerSelection
   - Verify both work independently

3. **Phase 3: Delete Operations**
   - Implement deleteItem
   - Test with both staged and existing items
   - Implement batchDeleteItems
   - Verify delete operations don't affect create

4. **Phase 4: Update Operations**
   - Implement stageUpdate
   - Test with both staged and existing items
   - Verify updates don't affect other operations

5. **Phase 5: Integration**
   - Add value prop handling
   - Implement clean data emission
   - Add comprehensive tests

### 5. Testing Strategy

Each function should be tested independently:

1. **Create Tests**
   - Single item creation
   - Batch creation
   - Duplicate prevention
   - State consistency

2. **Delete Tests**
   - Delete staged item
   - Delete existing item
   - Batch deletion
   - Delete then create same item

3. **Update Tests**
   - Update staged item
   - Update existing item
   - Update deleted item
   - Update then delete

4. **Integration Tests**
   - Multiple operations sequence
   - Value prop changes
   - API interactions
   - UI updates

### 6. Error Prevention

1. **State Mutations**
   - Always create new references
   - Use immer or similar for updates
   - Validate state after each operation

2. **Race Conditions**
   - Queue async operations
   - Use proper loading states
   - Handle concurrent updates

3. **Data Consistency**
   - Validate junction structure
   - Clean temporary fields
   - Maintain referential integrity

This plan ensures each staging function is:
- Independently implemented and tested
- Has clear responsibilities
- Maintains consistent state
- Updates UI predictably
- Handles errors gracefully

Follow this order strictly, and don't move to the next phase until current phase is fully tested and working.
